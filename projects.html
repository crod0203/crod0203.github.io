        <div class="col-sm-8 text-center"><br>The skills I was able to learn was the ability to use IDEâ€™s and the knowledge needed to use python classes effectively. This project assisted me to  become a better programmer  because I was able to create my own version of the snake game with the help of open source modules and implement my own code to make it unique.If you would like to see the code I wrote  for this game click here:

        <div class="col-sm-8 text-center"><br>This graph helped me better understand how to develop a graph to best demonstrate the data acquired. Through my data analysis project I was able to solidify my skills using conditionals and graphing modules because I was able to split the specific data in each line of the file automatically using a loop and be able to display that information clearly in a graph well suited for the information displayed.

        <div class="col-sm-8 text-center"><br>The skills I was able to learn was the ability to use python to separate data in a large file to view the information you are looking for. This project assisted me to  become a better programmer  because I was able to better develop my researching skills by using  open source modules to help me update my code. Also it led me to enhance my communication skills by making me more comfortable communicating my code errors with others and asking for help.  If  you would to read the full report click here:

        <div class="col-sm-8 text-center"><br>This project enhanced my security skills and tested my understanding of network infracture. We were asked to display the network infracture spefic to a place of our  choice. I chose my home and the  project illustratsed the process in a  real  work setting which leads to better understanding of the topic as a whole.

        <div class="col-sm-8 text-center"><br>Throughtout this project I had  to use my creativity and knowledge of network security to better secure a cell phone. The  skills I was able to learn was  the ability to add the appropaite software to secure the  cell phone. In addition, I enhanced my knowledge of network  security  by researching effective ways to secure devices through credible sources. Click here for the full project:
