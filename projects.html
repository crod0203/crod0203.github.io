        <div class="col-sm-8 text-center bg-dark"><br>This project was a test on the python fundamentals I had learned earlier in class. This project required us to create a game of our choice using python and build a code to make the game unique.I chose to make a snake game which I chose to call “Crawly the Snake” and I had a great experience with this project.
          The skills I was able to learn was the ability to use IDE’s and the knowledge needed to use python classes effectively.If you would like to see the code I wrote  for this game click here:

        <div class="col-sm-8 text-center text-dark"><br>For this project I were tasked to look at server data from NASA in 1995 and analyze the data to  extract the data we deemed important. The NASA file had millions of lines of data to sort through and I had to build a code to do it automatically. This code had to be able to read the whole file and extract the data we wanted even if  new data would be added to the file.With the data we extract we had to make a graph to accurately and properly represent the data.   
          This graph helped me better understand how to develop a graph to best demonstrate the data acquired. Through my data analysis project I was able to solidify my skills using conditionals and graphing modules because I was able to split the specific data in each line of the file automatically using a loop and be able to display that information clearly in a graph well suited for the information displayed.

        <div class="col-sm-8 text-center"><br>The skills I was able to learn was the ability to use python to separate data in a large file to view the information you are looking for. This project assisted me to  become a better programmer  because I was able to better develop my researching skills by using  open source modules to help me update my code. Also it led me to enhance my communication skills by making me more comfortable communicating my code errors with others and asking for help.  If  you would to read the full report click here:

        <div class="col-sm-8 text-center text-dark"><br>This project we were asked to make an accurate SOHO network of a place of choice. We had to make a diagram with the proper legend and  symbols to make it readable to anyone. This project enhanced my security skills and tested my understanding of network infracture. We were asked to display the network infracture spefic to a place of our  choice. I chose my home and the  project illustratsed the process in a  real  work setting which leads to better understanding of the topic as a whole.

        <div class="col-sm-8 text-center bg-dark"><br>For this project we were tasked to  pick any device and give many ways the device can be secured. We were tasked with finding the best and most efficient ways to keep the device safe from phishing and scams. I chose my  cell phone since  it is a big part of everyday life and it will be the  device  you need to keep very secure at all times.  
          Throughtout this project I had  to use my creativity and knowledge of network security to better secure a cell phone. The  skills I was able to learn was  the ability to add the appropaite software to secure the  cell phone. In addition, I enhanced my knowledge of network  security  by researching effective ways to secure devices through credible sources. Click here for the full project:
